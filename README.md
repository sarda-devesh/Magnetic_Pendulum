# Magnetic_Pendulum
 A magnetic pendulum simulator using VPython. Use the slider to choose the starting angle for the pendulum and then later to adjust the coeffcient for the magnetic force. Use c to change the type of magnets being added with blue being repelsive magnets (same sign as magnets on the bob) and red being attractive magnets (opposite sign as magnets on the bob). Press r to remove a magnet and choose the magnet to remove on the 2d projection plane. Finally, use q to end the program.
